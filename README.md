# Implementing Tic Tac Toe Game with Ruby

This is project is to demonstrate our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming Language in Ruby, building a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

## About the Game - Tic-Tac-Toe

According to Wikipedia Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## User Interface:
The game starts by calling the bin/main.rb file where all other classes are called/required.

# Input:
- At the beginning of the game, the two players are requested to enter their names, one after the other.
- The first person to enter his/her name automatically becomes player 1 and is requested to enter values 
between [1 - 9] to mark a piece on the board.
- Player 1 is automatically assigned to piece "X" and player 2 piece "O"


# Output:
- The board class is instantiated at the beginning of the game with unmarked spots 1 to 9 on a 3x3 grid.
- The game board is re-rendered on the screen to show player's current placement of piece. Example if 
  player 1 takes position 5, is replaced with "X" and becomes unvailable till the end of the game.
- This repeats until win or draw conditions are met
- Players instructions are error messages are displayed at each intervals to guide the players



Pseudocode:
Player Class:
Will interact with Board class to select where to place pieces
Pieces placed will be represented by X or O

Board Class:
Will display the game board as well as locations of marked spots
Take input from players to determine where to show marked spots

Game Class:
Will ask for players input in turns
Prevent illegal moves from players
Pass on information from Player Class to Board Class
To check if win conditions has been met
